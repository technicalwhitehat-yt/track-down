The tool hosts a fake website which uses an iframe to display a legit website and, if the target allows it, it will fetch the Gps location `(latitude and longitude)` of the target, capture multiple pictures of the target along with `IP Address` and `Device Information`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> <h4> This tool is a Proof of Concept and is for Educational Purposes Only. </h4> 
> Using this tool, you can find out what information a malicious website can gather about you and your devices and why you shouldn't click on random links or grant permissions like Location to them.

> [!CAUTION] 
> **Please use this responsibly and ethically.**
> <h4> DISCLAIMER </h4> 
> It is possible to use R4ven for nefarious purposes. It merely illustrates what adept attackers are capable of. Defenders have a responsibility to consider such attacks and protect their users from them. Using R4ven should only be done with the written permission of the targeted parties for legitimate penetration testing assignments.

### Key Features:

- IP address and GPS location tracking
- Collection of device system information
- Capturing images from the device's camera
- Inbuilt Auto port forwarding
- Integration with Discord for data presentation
- User interaction for location permission
- Display of a website through an embedded iframe
- Regular interval-based data collection
- Access to and upload webcam images
- Links to Google Maps and Google Earth based on location
- Error handling for denied location permission
- User feedback and error messages

---
### On the link click

```diff
+ It will automatically fetch the IP address and device information
! If location permission is allowed, it will fetch the exact location of the target.
! If camera permission is allowed, it will capture non-stop from the front camera.
```

### Limitation

```diff
- It will not work on laptops or phones that have no GPS or no Camera, 
# browsers that block javascript,
# or if the target is mocking the GPS location.
# or if a target is using VPN or spoofing IP

- Some browsers auto block location and camera permission like(Brave, Safari etc)
+ Location accuracy will be more accurate if you use this on a smartphone.

```

### IP location VS. GPS location

```diff
- Geographic location based on IP address is NOT accurate,
# Does not provide the location of the target. 
# Instead, it provides the approximate location of the ISP (Internet service provider)
```
```diff
+ GPS fetch almost exact location because it uses longitude and latitude coordinates.
@@ Once location permission is granted @@
# Accurate location information is received to within 20 to 30 meters of the user's location.
# (it's almost the exact location)
```
